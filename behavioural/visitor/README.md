# Visitor Design Pattern üåê

### What is It? üõ†Ô∏è

The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that:

- Separates algorithms from objects, allowing for flexible behavior modifications.
- Encourages adding new behaviors to objects without altering their structure.
- Is particularly useful when dealing with complex structures of objects.

<br>

### When to Use It? üí°

- When you need to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure.
- When you want to add new behaviors to existing objects without modifying their classes.
- When you need to keep related behaviors together in a separate class.

## Example - Geographic Information Export üó∫Ô∏è

Imagine developing a geographic information application that works with a graph of various entities like cities, industries, and sightseeing areas. You need to export this graph to different formats without altering the existing node classes. The Visitor Pattern allows you to create an external visitor class for exporting data into XML format and other formats in the future.

This pattern simplifies the process of adding new export formats, making your code more maintainable and extensible.

## Pattern Structure üß©

- **Element (Node):** The interface defining an 'accept' method that accepts a visitor as an argument. It may also provide additional methods specific to the element.

- **Concrete Elements:** Classes implementing the Element interface, each providing its implementation for the 'accept' method.

- **Visitor:** The interface defining visiting methods for each concrete element class. This allows different behaviors to be executed for different elements.

- **Concrete Visitor:** A class implementing the Visitor interface. It provides the behavior for exporting elements to XML format.
