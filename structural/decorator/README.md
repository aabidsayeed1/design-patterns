# Decorator Design Pattern üé®

### What is It? üõ†Ô∏è
The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to:

- Attach new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects.
- Extend an object's functionality without altering its structure.
- Compose objects with various combinations of behaviors at runtime.

<br>

### When to Use It? üí°
Use the Decorator pattern when:

- You need to add or alter behaviors of individual objects dynamically, without affecting other objects.
- You want to avoid class explosion due to creating numerous subclasses with different combinations of behaviors.
- You have a need to extend an object's functionality, but it's not feasible or desirable to use inheritance.

## Example - Notification Library üì¢
Imagine you have a notification library that initially supports sending messages via email. However, users want more options like SMS, Facebook, and Slack notifications. Using traditional inheritance would lead to a combinatorial explosion of subclasses, making the code complex.

The Decorator Pattern allows you to wrap a base notifier with decorators like SMSDecorator, FacebookDecorator, and SlackDecorator. These decorators dynamically add notification channels to the base notifier, giving users the flexibility to choose multiple notification methods.

## Pattern Structure üß©

- **Component:** Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.

- **Concrete Component:** Represents the base object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.

- **Decorator:** Maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to the Component's interface.

- **Concrete Decorator:** Adds responsibilities to the component.
